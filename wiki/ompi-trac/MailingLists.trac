= Private lists =

Why are there private lists in an open source project?  There are a few reasons:

 1. The administrative group's duties include, among other things, resolving conflicts.  These conversations are not intended to be public.
 1. Since the core development group contains several academics who rely on the "publish or perish" philosophy of competitive research, some discussions must be kept private until conference/journal papers can be written and published.
 1. Non-public information needs to be distributed among the core group that would not be good to be "Google-able", such as teleconference phone numbers/codes, trade show planning, etc.

Here are the private lists (admission to these lists is restricted):

 * [http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/admin Administrative:] The administrative steering group for Open MPI (see [wiki:"Admistrative rules"])
 * [http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/devel-core Development core:] Development group core
 * [http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/svn-private Private SVN commits:] Private SVN commits, including the OMPI SVN /tmp branches and the OMPI documents tree (for academic / not-yet-published papers), but the diff of the change is not included if it is over 40k
 * [http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/svn-private-full Private SVN commits (full):] Private SVN commits, including the OMPI SVN /tmp branches and the OMPI documents tree (for academic / not-yet-published papers); the diff of the change is ''always'' included in the mail, regardless of size
