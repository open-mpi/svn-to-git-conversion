The scripts in here are meant to be used for the Open MPI SVN -->
GitHub transition.

There's at least 4 parts:

1. SVN -> git translation, and then push to GitHub
   --> See the "runme.sh" script to do the whole thing (set some paths
       and variables up top first).

2. Trac wiki -> Git markdown translation, and then push to GitHub

3. Trac tickets -> Git issues translation

4. Convert OMPI tarball scripts to use git instead of svn
