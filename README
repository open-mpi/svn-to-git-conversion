From an email exchange:

1) git svn clone with latest hwloc changes and updated authors file
2) preprocess-repo.sh without argument
3) git filter-branch very long line
4) git push --mirror <wherever>

NOTE: git-svn sometimes duplicates entries in .git/config, which
causes warning messages in the conversion.  See
http://stian.almaas.me/2012/05/git-svn-refspec-glob-conflict.html.  I
deleted these extra/duplicated lines in the middle of the conversion,
and then the warnings went away.

----> Essentially: run the scripts/runme.sh script.
